# Third Party APIs - Daily Scheduler Homework Assignment

## What I attempted to do:

Create a password calendar with typical work day hours that is color coded according to past, present, and future hour time blocks. The user can enter and save tasks for each time block.This app uses jQuery and dynamically updated HTML.
